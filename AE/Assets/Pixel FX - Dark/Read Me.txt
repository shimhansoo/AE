FX DETAILS

Buff

- Animations: 1
- Frames: 16
- Loop: No 
- Details
	- This buff will imbue your armor with lightning attributes which may render you immune to lighting skills. Up to you.
	- The last frame (the lightning bolt over the head) is meant to follow the player around to indicate when the skill is active and when it expires.


Demon Ritual

- Animations: 4
- Frames: 35
- Loop: Yes 
- Details: 
	- The demon acts as a turret since it can not move.
	- You can add health to it if you want or you can just make it disappear after X amount of seconds.
	- The Demon hits all the enemies in front of him with its dark ray. You can loop it to make it infinite if you want.
	- One suggestion is to to make the screen shake when the spawn animation begins and right around the middle you can play a mighty roar. This roar can be used to put fear in your enemy decreasing their defense.
	- The demon comes with 4 animations
			1. Spawn
			2. Idle
			3. Attack (Start/Loop/End)
			4. Looped Dark Ray Extension
	

Dark I

- Animations: 1
- Frames: 14
- Loop: Yes 
- Details:
	- This is the first dark attack. It may be slow but when it hits it deals high damage. 
	- This attack only affects one enemy.


Dark II

- Animations: 1
- Frames: 15
- Loop: Yes
- Details: 
	- This attack can deal damage to all the enemies in its path or just one. 
	- There is possibility for this skill to also deal some poison de-buffs.


Dark III

- Animations: 4
- Frames: 52
- Loop: Yes 
- Details: 
	- This attack will summon hands and they will reach out to the enemies and hit them. 
	- Each hand is looped and can be used to cover the whole map if you want to!


Seeker

- Animations: 1
- Frames: 32
- Loop: No 
- Details: 
	- Sometimes offering your vision to the dark pays off (that is why the preview goes black). 
	- This skill allows the player to discover hidden chests that would not be found without dark powers. 
	- The seeker should last for some time and will follow the player around and can look in 4 directions.
	- Another way that you can use this skill is by again, trading your vision for a damage boost, the map goes black and then you have enemies remain the original colors (as I did with the chests).
	- Alternatively, the seeker casts rays at the enemies or increases drop rate of enemies upon defeat.


Doom

- Animations: 2
- Frames: 34
- Loop: Yes
- Details: 
	- This skill places a debuff on all the enemies in your sight.
	- I had a few ideas with this debuff. Don't forget to recolor the affected enemies!
			1. You can make it deal damage per second
			2. You summon the skull and it gives you a XX% chance to apply the debuff when you attack
			3. It deals no damage but it decreases the enemy defenses drastically.


Sorrow

- Animations: 1
- Frames: 17
- Loop: Yes 
- Details:
	- Shower your enemies in darkness for as long as this skill lasts.
	- You can also activate the debuff animation found under the Doom skill to amplify the damage that this skill does.
	- The preview shows all skeletons being hit at the same time but you can also use the Appear and Dissapear animations. 
			1. A way to use those would be by only summoning 1 skull on top of an enemy and once it is defeated the Disappear animation will play,
			2. The skull will teleport on top of another enemy and the Appear animation will play leading to the loop. 
			3. This gets repeated until all enemies are defeated.
