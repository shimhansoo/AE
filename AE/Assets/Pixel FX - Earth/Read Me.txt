FX DETAILS

Buff

- Animations: 1
- Frames: 16
- Loop: No 
- Details
	- You pray to Mother Earth a lot, you are now a rock. 
	- This buff will render you immune to Earth or Electric attacks or maybe just increase your defense against Earth or Electric attacks by X%. Your call. 
	- The last frame is the indicator that lets you know if the skills is active or inactive.

Earth I

- Animations: 1
- Frames: 15
- Loop: Yes 
- Details:
	- The first attack geomancers learn, it deals damage to the first enemy it touches.


Earth II

- Animations: 4
- Frames: 20
- Loop: No 
- Details: 
	- Instead of throwing a pebble, why not throw a barrage of stones at your enemy? 
	- These stones will hit a single enemy until they are defeated. 
	- If you want you can keep casting this spell and you can become a stone machine gun.


Earth III

- Animations: 1
- Frames: 23
- Loop: Yes 
- Details: 
	- Why not combine a bunch of stones to make a sharp projectile. 
	- Use this skill and pierce all the enemies in its path. The downfall is that it takes a bit of time to get it started. 
	- Maybe you can even add extra damage and a cooldown.


Golem

- Animations: 12
- Frames: 89
- Loop: Yes 
- Details:
	- This can be an enemy, or it can be a transformation skill. Become a golem for a certain amount of seconds or until your MP is 0 or until you are dealt a bunch of damage. 
	- One thing to note is that you can use the other skills with the golem as well. 
	- The only downfall of this skill is that you can not move! Use it at your own discretion. 
	- The golem comes with a summon, idle, attack 1, attack 2, hit, expire animation.
	- This skill also has 2 FX animations. The small punch on the floor will cause Earth spikes to hit your foes. 
	- The attack where he smashes the floor will push your enemies far away or just deal a lot of damage. 


Rockfall

- Animations: 6
- Frames: 36
- Loop: No 
- Details: 
	- Crush all the enemies in the map with them boulders a certain amount of seconds or while you keep casting the spell. 
	- What if you the character is on top of a mountain and only the sky is above him? Well then, call the skill Lunar Fall. 
	- What if you are in a cave? Well then make it deal double damage or increase the duration of the skill.


Stomp

- Animations: 4
- Frames: 45
- Loop: No
- Details: 
	- Break your opponent legs and send them flying if you have a game mechanism in place that can do that. 
	- Because I like Earth, there are variants of this skill. 
	- If you press the skill button for long periods of time it will consume more MP but will activate the stronger variants.


Wall

- Animations: 1
- Frames: 13
- Loop: No 
- Details: 
	- Place a wall between you and your foes. 
	- This wall will can stop all incoming attacks. 
	- You can add a health bar to the wall itself which decreases as it gets hit or just make the wall disappear after certain amount of seconds.
